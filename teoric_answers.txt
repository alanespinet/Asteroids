1- Three things to speed up a website: minify .js and .html files, reduce the
amount of css rules and use media queries to determine which js and css use
in a certain moment

2- Analyzing www.carnival.com: First, there are several .js files that can be
minified. Using uglifyjs could be a good alternative for that. In the same
way, it is possible to reduce html and css files using file compressors like
htmlcompressor.com and csscompressor.com. There are, also, some javascript files
used to block some parts of the page. It seems that removing those scripts
the site could be faster ( but it could be incomplete too, :) ). The files are
alreade minified, so PageSpeed Insights talks about banish them.
